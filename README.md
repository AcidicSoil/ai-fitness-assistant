# AI Fitness Assistant

This project is a starting point for building a fitness assistant powered by various Task Master tools.

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide your API keys. Node.js 18 or later is recommended.

## Running Tests

Tests are not yet implemented, but a basic test runner has been added to provide a placeholder entry point. Execute the following command to run the test script:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs `node ./tests/test-runner.js`, which currently prints a message and exits successfully. Replace the contents of `tests/test-runner.js` with real tests as the project evolves.
