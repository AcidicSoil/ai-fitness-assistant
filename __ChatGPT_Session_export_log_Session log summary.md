## 1️⃣ User Stories

### Core User Flows
- **As a fitness user**, I want to upload a photo/screenshot of my workout board so I can get a structured, editable workout plan.
- **As a trainer**, I want to manage multiple clients' workout boards so I can deliver organized training plans.
- **As a user**, I want to sync workouts to my personal calendar (Google/Apple/Outlook) so I get reminders.
- **As a user**, I want the app to suggest similar workouts weekly so I stay motivated.
- **As a user**, I want to view my workout history and personal records so I can track progress.
- **As a premium user**, I want to access extra features like advanced analytics or personalized recommendations.

### Admin/Dev Needs
- **As a developer**, I want clear API contracts so I can implement backend services smoothly.
- **As a developer**, I want a well-structured repo and CI/CD pipeline so I can ship features reliably.

## 4️⃣ Task Management & Sprints (Agile Setup)

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2)
✅ Set up repo, CI/CD, dev environment
✅ Build core API scaffolding (Express)
✅ Integrate image upload + OCR (Google Vision)
✅ Basic mobile app (React Native) with upload & display

### Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4)
✅ Build structured workout parser (backend)
✅ Sync with calendar APIs
✅ Implement user auth (Firebase)
✅ Build workout history UI

### Sprint 3 (Weeks 5–6)
✅ Add workout expansion (OpenAI GPT API)
✅ Integrate push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
✅ Stripe payment integration (freemium model)
✅ Beta test with users + collect feedback

### Sprint 4 (Weeks 7–8)
✅ Polish UI/UX
✅ Optimize AI flows (fallbacks, error handling)
✅ Prepare app store submissions
✅ Final testing + launch

### Task Management Tools
- Use **Jira** or **Notion** for backlog, sprint boards, and task assignments
- Define **clear acceptance criteria** per task
- Hold **weekly standups** + demos

## 🚀 Final Recommendations for Developers
✅ Prioritize **core flow first**: upload → OCR → structured plan
✅ Keep AI/ML parts **modular** to swap providers if needed
✅ Ensure **robust error handling** around external APIs (OCR, GPT)
✅ Regularly test on **real user data** (images, workouts)
✅ Document everything clearly in the repo, especially for onboarding
✅ Stay in sync with product/design for feature demos

If you want, I can also prepare a Notion board template or Jira sprint backlog pre-filled with tasks — just say the word!
