# masterplan.md – AI Fitness App Blueprint

---

## 1. App Overview & Objectives

Develop a mobile-first, hybrid fitness app that delivers curated workout experiences either through AI-driven routines or by intelligently analyzing user-uploaded workout boards (e.g., Pinterest, Instagram). The app transforms these into interactive, beautiful workout plans, provides best-in-class scheduling (with calendar sync and notifications), and aims to surpass industry leaders like Nike Training Club and Peloton in polish, motivation, and user experience.

---

## 2. Target Audience

- Fitness enthusiasts seeking engaging, personalized routines
- Personal trainers managing multiple clients and schedules
- Anyone motivated by progress tracking, scheduling, and social accountability

---

## 3. Core Features & Functionality

- **Image Upload & Workout Parsing**
  - Users upload images/screenshots of workout boards.
  - AI/OCR extracts exercises, sets, reps, and creates editable digital routines.

- **AI-Generated Workouts**
  - Self-curated routines based on user goals, fitness level, preferences.
  - Variety, progression, and adaptability built-in.

- **Interactive & Elegant Display**
  - Modern, cinematic visuals with dynamic UI.
  - Micro-animations, clear progress markers, motivational feedback.

- **Workout Editing & Progress Tracking**
  - Users can adjust routines, add notes, and log completed sessions.
  - Streaks, personal bests, analytics, and trophy/achievement system.

- **Scheduling & Calendar Integration**
  - Schedule single workouts or full programs (multi-day, multi-week).
  - Sync with device calendars (Google, Apple, Outlook).
  - Calendar events include workout details.
  - Visual scheduling tools (drag-and-drop, color coding).

- **Notifications & Smart Reminders**
  - Pre-workout reminders, motivational nudges, and completion feedback.
  - Users can snooze or reschedule directly from notifications.

- **Goal Setting & Recommendations**
  - Set, track, and celebrate fitness goals.
  - AI-driven suggestions for next workouts or new routines.

- **Trainer Dashboard (For Personal Trainers)**
  - Manage client rosters, assign/adjust plans, monitor client progress.
  - Feedback loops between trainer and client.

- **Community & Social (Future)**
  - Share routines, achievements, or join community challenges.
  - Leaderboards, group streaks, and encouragement.

## 4. Technical Stack Recommendations

- **Frontend:** React Native (mobile), ready for future web with React/Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (API), Python for ML/OCR tasks
- **AI/ML Services:** Google Vision AI (OCR), OpenAI GPT (workout parsing, recommendations)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Cloud Storage for image assets
- **Integrations:** Calendar APIs (Google, Apple, Outlook), Firebase (Auth, notifications)
- **DevOps:** Google Cloud Run or AWS Lambda (serverless), GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Docker (optional)

---

## 5. Conceptual Data Model

- **User:** id, profile, preferences, calendar tokens, progress, goals
- **Workout:** id, source (upload/AI), structured data (exercises, sets, reps), owner, status
- **Schedule/Event:** id, user, workout, datetime, recurrence, calendar sync status
- **Trainer/Client:** trainer_id, client_id(s), assignment metadata
- **Notification:** type, status, delivery/log
- **Progress/Record:** user_id, workout_id, session data, PRs, achievements

---

## 6. UI/UX Design Principles

- Inspired by Nike Training Club and Peloton: energetic, bold, high-contrast visuals, large imagery, motivating feedback
- Minimalist, frictionless navigation; progressive onboarding
- Highly responsive, accessible design (large touch targets, color/contrast options)
- Micro-animations and smooth transitions for modern polish

---

## 7. Security Considerations

- Secure OAuth2 for calendar and third-party integrations
- Encrypted endpoints for user data, image uploads, and history
- Adherence to mobile data, privacy, and notification best practices

---

## 8. Development Phases & Milestones

**Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (COMPLETE)**
- Requirements, flows, and design finalized

**Phase 2: Project Stub-Out**
- File/project structure, stubs for all core features, basic config and scaffolding

**Phase 3: Full Implementation**
- Core flows: upload/AI, workout management, scheduling, notifications, analytics, trainer dashboard
- UI/UX polish, integrations, QA

**Phase 4: Beta Testing & Feedback**
- User/trainer pilot, iterate on feedback, accessibility checks

**Phase 5: Launch**
- App store submission, final optimizations, go-live

---

## 9. Potential Challenges & Solutions

- **OCR/AI accuracy:** Industry APIs with fallback editing and user review
- **Calendar/notification reliability:** Platform-specific testing and robust error handling
- **User onboarding & engagement:** Motivational design, reminders, and easy wins

---

## 10. Future Expansion Possibilities

- Live classes or video coaching (with or without AI/AR guidance)
- Wearable/device integration (Apple Watch, Garmin, etc.)
- Advanced analytics (recovery, nutrition, etc.)
- Web app with extended trainer/admin features
- Community-driven programs, group challenges, and gamification

---

**Feedback/Next Steps:**
